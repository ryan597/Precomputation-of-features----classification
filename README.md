## 1. Environment

### Using [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dynamictexture
```

## 2. Data

Data is available to download from the [IR_Waveclass](https://github.com/dbuscombe-usgs/IR_waveclass) repository on github with the original train/test split. It is also supplied with this repositiory and split using the method described in our respective paper. ~~The bash script is also provided for grouping together waves.  We then hand split the waves into train and test groups to get the desired split ratio.~~
